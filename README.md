### Genz Notes
* Ts recommend to use Interface over Types when possible.
* so you should better use interface when you want to :
--- describe the object or a data  that you will be working as your business object before or in, for example, in your next year's application
--- working with huge object

* using type when you want to
--- type aliases
--- describe function types
